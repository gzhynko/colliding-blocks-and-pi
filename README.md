# colliding-blocks-and-pi
A simple simulation written in Rust inspired by [3Blue1Brown's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs) on colliding blocks that compute the value of pi.  
To modify the mass of the large block or its initial velocity, change the `large_block_mass_factor` or `large_block_velocity` values in `main.rs`.
## Compiling
To compile and run this Rust crate, use `cargo run --release`.
